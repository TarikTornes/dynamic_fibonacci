## dynamic\_fibonacci.rs

This is a small project suggested by "The Rust Programming Language Book" in end of chapter 3.
This snippet of code computes the n-th fibonacci number in a dynamic programming fashion using also the tools learned in the first three chapters:
- cargo package manager
- matching
- IO crate
- functions
- destructing
- partially the concept of ownership by using String and string slices through functions
